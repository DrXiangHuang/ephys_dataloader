## TODO
### HIGH
- Don't use 0 or 1 in clu (https://crcns.org/files/data/hc3/crcns-hc3-data-description.pdf)
- Add documentation for column names i.e. wfx corresponds to x = 32*(c-1) + (s-1) where c is the channel and s is the sample
- Add explanation of sample frequencies as in (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81127-5), also explain why rate is low for each individual wfx

### MEDIUM
- Add checks for incomplete extraction
- Highlight epochs using `sessInfo.Epochs` in preview
